  <h1>What is the Digital Marketing Framework?</h1>

  <p>
A marketer, whether for a small local florist, an agency with sophisticated clients, or a national retailer, faces the same core concepts. We contend that there is a set of timeless and universal marketing concepts. In this paper we submit that this set comprises seven key concepts and that these concepts are the nouns of marketing at the right level of abstraction. As you read about the concepts, you’ll recognize them as having been true in 1960 as much as they are today and will be in 2030.
  </p>
  <p>
Marketing in this digital age has grown in size, complexity, and sophistication. In practice, and in terms of budgets, a substantial part of marketing is advertising, the reaching out to an audience with the intention to influence their behavior to further the marketer’s goals. With strategy and tactics around product, price, placement, and promotion, the modern marketer in this digital age, influences with ever more precision and efficiency. Strength and success come from a deep understanding of the capabilities of each channel and the product-market fit. We extend the notion of product-market fit to now include audience-content fit for the purpose of the marketer’s success.
  </p>
  <p>
We have deconstructed marketing in order to better define its processes, to encourage interoperability of vendor solutions, to foster an open-source community of developers, and to set the stage for a series of innovations and digital marketing workflows around a common standard set of concepts. With these core concepts, Adobe lays the vocabulary for marketing in the digital age and defines marketing for decades to come.
  </p>
  <p>
The design of the language has already started. Seven core concepts of marketing have been identified and will be refined as needed. This vocabulary will directly influence the systems built around its words; and these systems will drive better marketing.
